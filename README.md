🤖 Advanced Customer Support AI Chatbot

An AI-powered customer support chatbot built with Deep Learning and NLP to automate customer queries and provide intelligent, real-time responses. This production-ready solution demonstrates how conversational AI can reduce support costs and enable 24/7 automated assistance.

🎯 Key Features

High-accuracy intent classification for customer queries (shipping, refunds, support)
Automated FAQ resolution with intelligent response selection
Scalable architecture for easy integration of new intents
Production-ready design with mock human handoff capability
RESTful API structure for seamless deployment


🛠️ Technology Stack

Python | TensorFlow/Keras | NLTK | NumPy | Flask
Deep Learning: Feed-Forward Neural Network with Dropout regularization
NLP: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Bag-of-Words vectorization


🧠 Technical Implementation

Data Pipeline: Structured intent dataset with preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization)
Model Architecture: Multi-layer FFNN with ReLU activation and Softmax output
Application Logic: Real-time intent prediction with dynamic response generation
Deployment: Flask-based API structure for production integration


▶️ Quick Start

bash# Run in Google Colab or locally
1. Upload intents.json and model files
2. Install dependencies: pip install tensorflow nltk numpy flask
3. Execute cells sequentially
4. Interact with the chatbot


🚀 Future Enhancements
